# Unsupervised Learning on Titanic Dataset (Stand-Alone)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Unsupervised Machine Learning** techniques on a standalone Titanic-like dataset.  
It includes:

**K-Means Clustering**  
**PCA Dimensionality Reduction**  
**Cluster Visualization**  
No dependency on any previous project

## Objectives

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- A Titanic dataset is generated inside the script.
- Categorical features (`Sex`, `Embarked`) are numerically encoded.
- All features are standardized using `StandardScaler`.

### 2. Clustering (K-Means)
- Apply **K-Means** with 2 clusters.
- Assign cluster labels to each passenger.

### 3. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
- Reduce dataset to **2 principal components**.
- Visualize the clusters in 2D space.

Visualization

A scatter plot is created using PCA components:

Each point = passenger

Colors represent K-means clusters

Easy visual understanding of cluster separation

Conclusion

In this project, unsupervised learning was successfully applied to the Titanic dataset.

K-Means helped identify hidden patterns in the passenger data.

PCA reduced the dataset to 2 dimensions, enabling easy visualization.

This demonstrates the fundamental workflow of clustering + dimensionality reduction in machine learning.
